        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My ex-wife made this version of chicken quesadillas. It is the best I have ever tried. I can't find a 
            restaurant that makes it this way. The secret is both the picante and cream cheese. Together, they make 
            an amazing sauce. 
        </p>
        <p>I am convinced that if I sold these on a food truck (along with churros), I'd make quite a bit of money. It 
            is also important, but probably not necessary, to shred the chicken as well. This can easily be done with two forks. 
            The idea is to hold the chicken up over a pot with one fork and to shred it using the second fork.
