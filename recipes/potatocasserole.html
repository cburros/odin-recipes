        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This potato casserole is a family favorite. We enjoy it during every holiday and it has become
            such a treasure to me that I've memorized the recipe. This recipe has gotten me through
            some very difficult times. In fact, I am tempted to make it now. 
        </p>
        <p>What makes this recipe extra special is that we add Corn Flakes on the top to give it an extra
        crunch. By the way: Definitely <strong>DO NOT</strong> use Frosted Flakes! Also, if you add exta of
        any ingredient, that just makes the whole dish better. It is hard to mess this one up.
