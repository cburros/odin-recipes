        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I like to make spaghetti. It is somewhat simple, I know how to do it, and it lasts for multiple
            meals. However, I commit what some consider a culinary crime when I make my spaghetti - I break
            my noodles. I am too busy, I don't have time to twist noodles on my fork.
        </p>
        <p>I really enjoy spaghetti with meat sauce, but that requires dirtying 3 pots and a skillet so it 
            can make cleanup a real chore. Also, it's hard to drain the water. Once I accidentally dumped all 
            of my spaghetti noodles down the drain.
